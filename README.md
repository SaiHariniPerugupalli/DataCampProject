DATASET:
The dataset consistes of two files: CSV and JSON files. You can download the datasets I uploaded or you can find this project on DataCamp and solve online in the website without downloading the datasets. 
INSTALLATION:
If you're not working on this project in DataCamp, then, this Project requires "python" and the following libraries installed:
pandas, StandardScaler, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy.
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
CODE:
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). 
First made use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors you should be aware of when doing machine learning
Next, used the scikit-learn package to predict whether am I correctly classifying a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc.
Implemented common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
